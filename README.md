- 👋 Hi, I’m @gregor-valentin-dfx
- 👀 I’m interested in saving time with devops and mastering the art of automation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Terraform to sculpt infrastructure like a digital Michelanangelo.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on docker and an all things DevOps; let's code our way to efficiency!
- 📫 How to reach me: Drop me an email at mailto:gregor.valentin@digitalfabrix.de, and let's script the next chapter of our collaboration.
- 😄 Pronouns: Git/Wizard, because I magically merge branches and cast spells with version control!
- ⚡ Fun fact: My coding dojo is also my karate dojo—I believe in the power of discipline, whether it's writing code or executing a high kick
